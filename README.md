# Beginner-AI-Knowledgebase
Just documentation I'm building up as I learn NLP and GPT and throwing into the wiki here.

ChatGPT is amazing and I'm curious about some of the open source equivalents like GPT-J-6B and GPT Neo 2.7B. What would be nice is for there to be some straight forward step by step guides that would both explain it all in one place and also how to get started quickly and easily on a local PC.
